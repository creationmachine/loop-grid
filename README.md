===

Make grid based controllers that trigger events and record loops using [soundbank](https://github.com/mmckegg/soundbank) and [loop-recorder](https://github.com/mmckegg/loop-recorder).

Add a bunch of [soundbank-chunk](https://github.com/mmckegg/soundbank-chunk) instances to the grid and position/shape acordingly.

Implements [observ](https://github.com/raynos/observ) for easy data-binding to your views.

For an example of mapping to a midi controller see [loop-launchpad](https://github.com/mmckegg/loop-launchpad).

## Work in progress

Just a code/idea spew at the moment.
